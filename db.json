Put on your winter coat and stroll through the 2,100-acre park, which includes historical attractions like Peirce Mill, as well as a nature center (step in for warmth, if you need to), picnic areas and playing fields. Inside the nature center, there’s also a planetarium, so you and your sweetie can stargaze."

Rose Previte’s Maydan, named one of 2018’s best new restaurants in America by Bon Appétit, fires off flavors from the Middle East and North Africa. A Georgian feast awaits at Supra in Shaw, where the khachapuri (housemade bread filled with cheese) cannot be missed. Ambar in Capitol Hill brings Balkan cuisine to the heart of DC, offering mezze, spreads, flatbreads, meat and poultry and much more."

You’ll be provided with scenic views of one of DC’s most historic neighborhoods. Visit the trail on a sunny afternoon, and we’re sure you’ll come away with some Instagram-worthy shots of you and your date.

There's also Union Stage, a dynamic spot that offers a packed calendar with a wide range of independent acts paired perfectly with beers and pizza from their Tap Room."
